### Prediction of Insulin Usage in Medical Data
In the ever-evolving landscape of healthcare, leveraging the power of data and machine learning has 
become instrumental in enhancing our understanding of medical trends and improving patient care. 
This project delves into the realm of predictive modeling within medical data, specifically focusing on 
the intricate task of forecasting insulin usage among patients. Harnessing the capabilities of machine 
learning algorithms, we aim to develop a predictive model that discerns which patients are more 
likely to require insulin based on a myriad of medical features.

### Prerequisites :
Before getting started, ensure that you have the following Python libraries installed:
- matplotlib
- plotly
- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- seaborn
We can install them using pip command

Like **pip install matplotlib plotly numpy pandas scikit-learn seaborn**

### Dataset :

The dataset used in this project is extracted from the "diabetic_data.csv" file. It contains information 
about patients, including their race, gender, age, type of admission, length of hospital stay, and other 
medical features. The goal is to predict whether a patient will use insulin or not.

### Project Steps :

The project follows these steps:

- Data Exploration : Explore the dataset to understand its structure, identify relevant columns, 
and perform preliminary analysis.
- Data Preprocessing: Process the data by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing 
values, and encoding categorical values.
- Data Visualization: Use graphs to visualize the distribution of age, race, type of admission, 
etc., to gain a better understanding of the data.
- Modeling : Employ multiple classification models, including Random Forest, Logistic 
Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and SVM, to predict insulin usage. Evaluate the 
models using metrics such as precision, recall, and F1 score.
- Cross-Validation :Assess the models' generalization capability by performing cross-validation, dividing the dataset into multiple folds and calculating mean performance scores.
- Grid search with the neural network algorithm: The Grid Search part in the context of 
Neural Networks involves systematically searching for the best combinations of 
hyperparameters for a given neural network model. Hyperparameters are model parameters 
that are not learned directly from training data but need to be specified before the learning 
process.
In the specific case of neural networks, some commonly adjusted hyperparameters include:
  - Activation Function: This is the function applied to the output of each unit (or 
neuron) in a network layer. Common examples include ReLU, Sigmoid, and Tanh.
  - Hidden Layer Sizes: This refers to the number of neurons in each hidden layer of the 
network. The network structure, including the number and size of hidden layers, can 
significantly impact performance.
  - Alpha: This is a regularization parameter that controls the magnitude of the 
network's weights. It helps prevent overfitting by adding a penalty for the complexity 
of the model.

The Grid Search explores different combinations of these hyperparameters using a 
predefined grid of values for each hyperparameter. For each combination, the model is 
trained and evaluated using cross-validation on the training set. The combination of 
hyperparameters that yields the best performance is then selected.

### Results :

The machine learning models developed for predicting insulin usage in medical data, including 
RandomForest, Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Neural Networks, and SVM, achieved outstanding 
performance with precision, recall, and F1-Score scores consistently exceeding 91%. While this 
suggests a strong fit to the training data, the potential for overfitting was addressed through cross-validation, demonstrating consistent high performance across different dataset subsets.
The Neural Networks model, after hyperparameter optimization, exhibited improved accuracy at 
93.55%. These results underscore the models' potential for accurate predictions in various medical 
scenarios. However, vigilance for overfitting and ongoing validation on new datasets are emphasized 
to ensure the models' reliability and applicability in real-world healthcare contexts.

### Conclusion :
In conclusion, our machine learning models, particularly the Neural Networks model with refined 
hyperparameters, exhibit significant potential for accurately predicting insulin usage in diverse 
medical scenarios. Nevertheless, ongoing vigilance for overfitting and continuous validation on 
new datasets remains essential for ensuring the reliability and applicability of these models in 
real-world healthcare settings.
